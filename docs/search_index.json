A symptom of this is a player that devotes a lot of his time to maintaining a forum or helping to create things for the entire community (think Wikipedia or Open Source projects). This also comes into play when someone has Beginners Luck  an effect where people believe they have some type of gift that others dont or believe they were lucky to get that amazing sword at the very beginning of the game.

The word challenge here is very important, as a badge or trophy without a challenge is not meaningful at all. This is also the core drive that is the easiest to design for and coincidently is where most of the PBLs: points, badges, leaderboards mostly focus on. "],["3-3-cd3-empowerment-of-creativity-feedback.html", "3.3 (CD3) Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback", " 3.3 (CD3) Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback Empowerment of Creativity &amp; Feedback is when users are engaged in a creative process where they have to repeatedly figure things out and try different combinations. People not only need ways to express their creativity, but they need to be able to see the results of their creativity, receive feedback, and respond in turn. This is why playing with Legos and painting are fun in-and-of themselves and often become Evergreen Mechanics, where a game-designer no longer needs to continuously add more content to keep the activity fresh and engaging. "],["3-4-cd4-ownership-possession.html", "3.4 (CD4) Ownership &amp; Possession", " 3.4 (CD4) Ownership &amp; Possession This is the drive where users are motivated because they feel like they own something. When a player feels ownership, she innately wants to make what she owns better and own even more. Besides being the major core drive for wanting to accumulate wealth, this deals with many virtual goods or virtual currencies within systems. Also, if a person spends a lot of time to customize her profile or her avatar, she automatically feels more ownership towards it too. Finally, this is also the core drive that makes collecting stamps or puzzle pieces fun. "],["3-5-cd5-social-influence-relatedness.html", "3.5 (CD5) Social Influence &amp; Relatedness", " 3.5 (CD5) Social Influence &amp; Relatedness This drive incorporates all the social elements that drive people, including: mentorship, acceptance, social responses, companionship, as well as competition and envy. When you see a friend that is amazing at some skill or owns something extraordinary, you become driven to reach the same level. Also, it includes the drive we have to draw closer to people, places, or events that we can relate to. If you see a product that reminds you of your childhood, the sense of nostalgia would likely increase the odds of you buying the product. This Core Drive is relatively well-studied too, as many companies these days are putting a lot of priority on optimizing their online social strategies. "],["3-6-cd6-scarcity-impatience.html", "3.6 (CD6) Scarcity &amp; Impatience", " 3.6 (CD6) Scarcity &amp; Impatience This is the drive of wanting something because you cant have it. Many games have Appointment Dynamics (come back 2 hours later to get your reward)  the fact that people cant get something right now motivates them to think about it all day long. This is the Core Drive utilized by Facebook when it first started: at first it was just for Harvard. Then it opened up to a few other prestigious schools, and eventually all colleges. When it finally opened up to everyone, many people wanted to join because they previously couldnt get in it. "],["3-7-cd7-unpredictability-curiosity.html", "3.7 (CD7) Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity", " 3.7 (CD7) Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity Generally, this is a harmless drive of wanting to find out what will happen next. If you dont know whats going to happen, your brain is engaged and you think about it often. Many people watch movies or read novels because of this drive. However, this drive is also the primary factor behind gambling addiction. Also, this core drive is utilized whenever a company runs a sweepstake or lottery program to engage users. The very controversial Skinner Box experiments, where an animal irrationally presses a lever frequently because of unpredictable results, are exclusively referring to the core drive of Unpredictability &amp; Curiosity, although many have misunderstood it as the driver behind points, badges, and leaderboard mechanics in general. "],["3-8-cd8-loss-avoidance.html", "3.8 (CD8) Loss &amp; Avoidance", " 3.8 (CD8) Loss &amp; Avoidance This core drive is based upon the avoidance of something negative happening. On a small scale, it could be to avoid losing previous work. On a larger scale, it could be to avoid admitting that everything you did up to this point was useless because you are now quitting. Also, opportunities that are fading away have a strong utilization of this Core Drive, because people feel like if they didnt act immediately, they would lose the opportunity to act forever.

Abstract - Games are ordered activities, generally undertaken for recreation. The design elements of these games are being used by people all around the planet to make this world a better place. The opportunities for gamification are being discussed in this chapter along with the use of a decision-making method as both have been applied to the study using a local running mobile application as platform for encouraging students enrolled in various educational institutions to promote avoidance of mess food wastage and in gaining confidence to integrate to use this approach to fight the cause of this global malady in their everyday life. The overarching issue of student mentality about food wastage is being discussed along with how to merge gamification with digital technology in this aspect and its participatory design. This provides the background for addressing points of using a gameful system to foster empowerment and connection among the students of NIT Jalandhar where this case was studied and the proposed approach was implemented.

Abstract - Research and development are important for the sustenance of any modern economy. Hence, in any society it is important to have a strong supply of scientists and engineers. From an Indian context, it is observed, however, that very few engineers choose to pursue research as their primary domain of interest. This chapter tries to identify from an institutional perspective on why engineers repeatedly shun their core branch subjects to pursue something else. The study highlights the mental framework of an engineering student and how the environment can be molded to invoke the interest of the student towards research and development. A gamified approach to solving this problem is proposed. The entire problem is fit into a gamification framework called Octalysis to identify the core motivators for engaging students in research. Finally, the chapter proposes reforms that can be adopted in order to create a holistic environment where students can participate freely and engage positively in cutting-edge projects.

Abstract - We all travel to different historical places but rarely notice the cultural significance of the place: the history behind the various things and locations. The primary aim of this chapter is to devise and develop means to enhance tourism and provide culturally important knowledge to people. Moreover, internet is booming, and the number of smartphones is increasing day by day. The same is happening in many developing countries. Therefore, in this chapter, the authors propose a criterion that uses technology to promote historical significance and enhances tourism industry as well. The proposed app uses the concept of gamification that acts as a platform to fuel the process of branding in a manner that engages the tourists and provide them with an experience that can make them feel more connected to the tourism destinations.
